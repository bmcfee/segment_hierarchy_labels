\section{Results}

\subsection{Figures}
Frontiers requires figures to be submitted individually, in the same order as they are referred to in the manuscript. Figures will then be automatically embedded at the bottom of the submitted manuscript. Kindly ensure that each table and figure is mentioned in the text and in numerical order. Permission must be obtained for use of copyrighted material from other sources (including the web). Please note that it is compulsory to follow figure instructions. Figures which are not according to the guidelines will cause substantial delay during the production process.

\textbf{\refstepcounter{table}\label{Tab:02} Table \arabic{table}.}{ Resolution Requirements for the figures}

\processtable{}
{\begin{tabular}{lllll}\toprule
Image Type & Description & Format & Color Mode & Resolution\\\midrule
Line Art & An image composed of lines and text,  & TIFF, JPEG & RGB, Bitmap & 900 - 1200 dpi\\
           & which does not contain tonal or shaded areas.& & &\\
           Halftone & A continuous tone photograph, which contains no text. & TIFF, EPS, JPEG & RGB, Grayscale & 300 dpi\\
Combination & Image contains halftone + text or line art elements. & TIFF, JPEG & RGB,Grayscale & 600 - 900 dpi\\\botrule
\end{tabular}}{}
\end{table}

\textbf{Table \ref{Tab:02}} shows the resolution requirements for the figures. The figures must be legible:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The smallest visible text is no less than 8 points in height, when viewed at actual size.
\item Solid lines are not broken up.
\item Image areas are not pixelated or stair stepped.
\item Text is legible and of high quality.
\item Any lines in the graphic are no smaller than 2 points width.
\item The actual size of the figure must be of at least 8.5 cm.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Nomenclature}
\begin{itemize}
\item The use of abbreviations should be kept to a minimum. Non-standard abbreviations should be avoided unless they appear at least four times, and defined upon first use in the main text. Consider also giving a list of non-standard abbreviations at the end, immediately before the Acknowledgments.
\item Gene symbols should be italicized; protein products are not italicized.
\item Chemical compounds and biomolecules should be referred to using systematic nomenclature, preferably using the recommendations by IUPAC.
\item We encourage the use of Standard International Units in all manuscripts.
\item To take part in the Resource Identification Initiative, please cite antibodies, genetically modified organisms, software tools, data, databases and services using the corresponding catalog number and RRID in your current manuscript. For more information about the project and for steps on how to search for an RRID, please click \href{http://www.frontiersin.org/files/pdf/letter_to_author.pdf}{here}.

Additional Requirements:
\subsection{Corrections}

If you need to communicate important changes to a published article please submit a General Commentary. Submit the article with the title “Corrigendum: Original Title of Article”.

\subsection{Commentaries on Articles}

At the beginning of your Commentary, please provide the citation of the article commented on. Rebuttals may be submitted in response to Commentaries; our limit in place is one commentary and one response. Rebuttals should also be submitted as General Commentary articles.

\subsection{Human Search and Animal Research}

All experiments on live vertebrates or higher invertebrates must be performed in accordance with relevant institutional and national guidelines and regulations. In the manuscript, authors must identify the committee approving the experiments and must confirm that all experiments conform to the relevant regulatory standards. For manuscripts reporting experiments on human subjects, authors must identify the committee approving the experiments and must also include a statement confirming that informed consent was obtained from all subjects. In Original Research Articles and Clinical Trial Articles these statements should appear in the Materials and Methods section.

\subsection{Clinical Trial Registration}

Clinical trials should be registered in a public trials registry in order to become the object of a publication at Frontiers. Trials must be registered at or before the start of patient enrollment. A clinical trial is defined as "any research study that prospectively assigns human participants or groups of humans to one or more health-related interventions to evaluate the effects on health outcomes."(\href{www.who.int/ictrp/en}{www.who.int/ictrp/en}). A list of acceptable registries can be found at \href{www.who.int/ictrp/en}{www.who.int/ictrp/en} and \href{www.icmje.org}{www.icmje.org}.

\subsection{Inclusion of Proteomics Data}

Authors should provide relevant information relating to how the peptide/protein matches were undertaken, including methods used to process and analyze data, false discovery rates (FDR) for large-scale studies and threshold or cut-off rates for peptide and protein matches. Further information could include software used, mass spectrometer type, sequence database and version, number of sequences in database, processing methods, mass tolerances used for matching, variable/fixed modifications, allowable missed cleavages, etc.

Authors should provide as supplementary material information used to identify proteins and/or peptides. This should include information such as accession numbers, observed mass (m/z), charge, delta mass, matched mass, peptide/protein scores, peptide modification, miscleavages, peptide sequence, match rank, matched species (for cross species matching), number of peptide matches, ambiguous protein/peptide matches should be indicated, etc.
For quantitative proteomics analyses authors should provide information to justify the statistical significance including biological replicates, statistical methods, estimates of uncertainty and the methods used for calculating error.

For peptide matches with biologically relevant post-translational modifications (PTM) and for any protein match that has occurred using a single mass spectrum, authors should include this information as raw data, annotated spectra or submit data to an online repository (recommended option).
Authors are encouraged to submit raw or matched data and 2-DE images to public proteomics repositories. Submission codes and/or links to data should be provided within the manuscript.

\subsection{Data Sharing}

Frontiers supports the policy of data sharing, and authors are advised to make freely available any materials and information described in their article, and any data relevant to the article (while not compromising confidentiality in the context of human-subject research) that may be reasonably requested by others for the purpose of academic and non-commercial research.
